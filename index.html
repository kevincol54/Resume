<p>Before becoming a full-stack web developer, I worked for several companies in tech, IT and management roles. My different roles have provided me the experience of collaborating with teams that require strong communication skills, an eye for detail and truly learning the importance of hard work and having a passion for solving problems. </p>

<p><strong>Project Team Specialist</strong><br><strong>Best Buy Corporate</strong><br><em>February 2011 - March 2014</em><br>
I started with Best Buy in 2011 as a Sales Support associate until being promoted several times and finally reaching the corporate level. During my time there, I had a variety of responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented new interactive network displays and new vendor displays throughout stores across the United States.</li>
<li>Executed the installation of all IT related equipment and cabling for approximately 75+ store remodels, 50+ transformations and 5+ new store openings.</li>
<li>Managed and motivated teams in the merchandising of stores during transformations.</li>
<li>Solved complex IT problems while working on diverse teams.</li>
<li>Introduced new technologies and methods to help solve seemingly insurmountable problems that arose out of state when the right tools were not available.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Web Sales Manager &amp; Webmaster</strong><br><strong>Barston’s Child’s Play</strong><br><em>November 2009 - December 2010</em><br>
My Tenure at Barston's started with warehouse work and eventually transitioned into a role that utilized my abilities and passions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Responsible for the online web store’s general maintenance and front end development.</li>
<li>Monitored and oversaw all web sales (receiving orders, processing orders, picking of orders from warehouse and shipping of all orders).</li>
<li>Performed graphics work on the site's front end, while maintaining an up-to-date online catalog of 2,500+ available products.</li>
<li>Oversaw the SEO strategies for company website.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Tour Manager</strong><br><strong>Various Bands/Tours</strong><br><em>June 2008 - October 2009</em><br>
I have always had a love and passion for all things music. Started working as a merchandise salesman for bands, eventually transitioning into tour management, which gave me many translatable skills:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coordinated all travel arrangements of artists to ensure they made it safely from city to city, arrived on time at venue and were prepped and ready to perform on time each night with all of their required gear.</li>
<li>Managed teams of people on a day to day basis to build a cohesive,  smooth-running tour. </li>
<li>Responsible for the assembly of daily schedules and the organization of day to day activities for each artist and all members traveling with artist/tour.</li>
<li>Worked with and for a wide variety of individuals that taught me how to collaborate effectively with people with very different view points and backgrounds.</li>
